# olympic
For a project based on Olympics data analysis, the primary focus will be on exploring  and understanding the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and  uncovering trends and insights related to athletes, countries, and sports over the  years.
We'll use the following columns for our analysis:
 ● City: The city where the Olympics took place.
 ● Year: The year of the Olympics.
 ● Sport: The sport the event is categorized under.
 ● Discipline: A subcategory of the sport.
 ● Event: The specific event within a discipline.
 ● Athlete: The name of the athlete who participated.
 ● Gender: The gender of the athlete.
 ● Country_Code: The country code (abbreviation).
 ● Country: The full name of the country.
 ● Event_gender: The gender category of the event.
 ● Medal: The medal won (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
 Objective
 The primary goal is to:
1. Analyze the dataset to understand trends in medal distribution.
 2. Identify the top-performing countries and athletes.
 3. Study the gender distribution of events and medals.
 4. Visualize the data using Python.
 Steps:
 1. Data Preparation:
 ○ Import libraries.
 ○ Loadthe dataset.
 ○ Clean the dataset (handling missing values, if any).
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 ○ Summarystatistics of the dataset.
 ○ Plot and analyze trends of medals across years.
 ○ Identify the top-performing athletes and countries.
 3. Visualizing Key Insights:
 ○ Visualize the distribution of medals by country, year, and sport.
 ○ Analyze gender distribution in different sports/events.
 4. Predictive Analysis:
 ○ Train a machine learning model to predict whether an athlete will win a
 medal based on their country, sport, and other attributes
